**Current Assumption![ref1]**

GameCo's executive board assumes that sales for various geographic regions have remained consistent over time. This assumption guides their planning for the 2017 marketing budget, with an expectation that historical sales trends will continue into the future. In the following slides, we will explore key findings that challenge this assumption and provide insights to inform strategic decisions for the upcoming marketing budget.

Our sales data reveals a significant  ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.1b78331b-b37d-4e73-939f-1d1de8a8ee51.003.png)trend a steady increase in sales until  2008, reaching a peak, followed by a  subsequent decline from 2009 to 2016.  This challenges our assumption of  consistent regional sales over time and  underscores the need for a deeper  analysis to optimize our 2017  marketing budget allocation. 

Our analysis reveals interesting  ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.1b78331b-b37d-4e73-939f-1d1de8a8ee51.004.png)trends in regional sales. Japan's sales,  sometimes surpassing other regions,  suggest untapped potential. Also,  Europe's consistent growth,  surpassing North America in 2016,  signals the need to adapt to market  trends. Notably, North America  declined in 2016, highlighting the  urgency of strategic adjustment. 

**Revised Understanding: Insights from Data Analysis![ref1]**

- Based on the data, we now understand that our assumptions about consistent regional sales over time were inaccurate. 
- While the data reveals promising opportunities for growth in markets like Japan and Europe, it also highlights challenges such as declining sales in North America. 
- Our action plan includes revising our marketing strategies for key regions, conducting further market research to better understand consumer preferences.
- Racing (70%) and Strategy  ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.1b78331b-b37d-4e73-939f-1d1de8a8ee51.005.png)(64%) are highly popular  genres in Europe. 
- In Japan, Racing is negligible  (1%), while Simulation (77%),  Misc (69%), and Role-Playing  (54%) dominate. 
- Simulation has no presence  in North America, registering  at 0%. 

**Recommendations![ref1]**

- Increase the number of game titles for popular genres in each region to capitalize on consumer demand and maximize market share.
- Customize marketing strategies to align with regional genre preferences.
- Adapt game content to suit the unique tastes of each region, enhancing consumer engagement and satisfaction.
- Implement ongoing monitoring to stay abreast of evolving consumer preferences and market trends.
- Gather feedback from players across different regions to improve future marketing strategies, ensuring they meet customer preferences effectively.
